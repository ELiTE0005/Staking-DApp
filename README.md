## üìå Problem Statement

PS 4: Craft the Future of Onchain Consumer Experiences with Base 

>> built with Ethereum !

## üéØ Objective

Problems with Existing Platforms


New blockchain startups struggle to raise funds due to the complex and expensive process
of launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
Users often face long lock-up periods with penalties for early withdrawals.
Some platforms even block withdrawals during volatile market conditions.
Many platforms don‚Äôt disclose how rewards are calculated, leading to fluctuating and
unreliable APYs.


**Why Stake-X ?**


Dynamic ICO Pricing ‚Äì The price of the token auto-adjusts based on staking demand
more staking = higher initial value.
Dynamic APY Management - It adjusts interest rates based on pool liquidity, offering
users the best possible returns.
Liquidity Optimization - Provides up to 80% liquidity access, ensuring efficient use of
user assets + APY yield Pool
Enhanced Decision-Making - Features an interactive APY estimator, helping users visualize
trends and make smarter financial choices.

### Your Approach:  
- Why I chose this problem  ? 

New blockchain startups struggle to raise funds due to the complex and expensive process
of launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
Users often face long lock-up periods with penalties for early withdrawals.
Some platforms even block withdrawals during volatile market conditions.
Many platforms don‚Äôt disclose how rewards are calculated, leading to fluctuating and
unreliable APYs.


- One of the biggest hurdles I faced was ensuring accurate and real-time APY (Annual Percentage Yield) calculation based on dynamic staking pool liquidity as initially, our reward logic wasn‚Äôt updating correctly, leading to inconsistent returns shown in the APY estimator [Improper handling of async/await with ethers.js]

here how I fixed it :

Implementing real-time event listeners using ethers.js to listen for StakeUpdated and RewardsCalculated events and the best part ? refactoring the APY logic to fetch on-chain data at regular intervals :-)
